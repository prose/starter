Starter is a barebones starting point for responsive sites built on Jekyll and with
site management in [prose](http://prose.io). To get started, Fork this repo and [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).

To work on the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/starter/` in your browser.

If you notice any problems or would like to contribute to the project start a discussion from the [issues page](https://github.com/prose/starter/issues)
