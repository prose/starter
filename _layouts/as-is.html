This template simply returns the contents of the (un)decorated file, parsed by Jekyll.
It is used in the generation of the pdf file by wkhtmltopdf, where it is desirable
to pass a header.html and footer.html that contain html, body and head tags
that are stripped during pdf generation.  Because of the existence of those
html, body, and head tags, it is not possible to define the header.html and
footer.html as jekyll includes (otherwise those tags would be duplicated).

Nevertheless, by using this undecorated template, it is possible to render the
header.html and footer.html as-is, but have it parsed by jekyll, thus having
access to all jekyll variables.
