###Challenge:  
Ecommerce organizations looking to remain competitive in a multi-platform world—by evolving from a traditional waterfall visual design approach to a flexible framework like Responsive Web Design (RWD) — confront inevitable challenges to their existing workflow, skillsets, staffing and institutional culture.

###Solution:  
Fluid was engaged to establish how {{site.client.name}}'s internal digital disciplines should best work together to support a more flexible framework for digital design, and in the process, work more collaboratively as an agile organization that can respond nimbly and efficiently to the rapid evolution of digital design practices.  

###Methodology

* Initial project scoping with {{site.client.name}}
* An on-site kickoff to introduce the project, level set terminology and internal expectations and provide a framework for research and analysis
* Stakeholder interviews and follow-up conversations to determine current organizational strengths and weaknesses
* Analysis of internal documentation and industry best practices
* Articulation of common pain points and solutions from Fluid's client roster
* Synthesis of {{site.client.name}}'s culture, staffing and workflow with all of the above
