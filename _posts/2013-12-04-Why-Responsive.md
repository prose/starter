###Retail in a Multi-Device World

Customers are embracing an increasing range of touchpoints as they bank, shop, and look for services online. Mobile phones, tablets, and social networks all play a vital role in the increasingly complex customer journeys that consumers now take. With the proliferation of mobile devices, in particular, multi-screen viewing is rapidly becoming the norm in the United States.

Although the majority of ecommerce purchases still occur via desktop, smartphones and increasingly tablets play an indispensible role in the purchase funnel, both for research and conversion.

###Year of the Tablet
For the first time since its creation, tablet use has become mainstream in the US. eMarketer estimates that in 2013, a majority of US internet users (52.6%) will also be tablet users.  All told, there will be 128.1 million US tablet users this year, a figure that includes individuals of any age who use a tablet at least once per month. And increasingly, their tablets are being used as a primary Internet device, experts say.

In 2012, tablets for the first time were responsible for a majority of US retail m-commerce sales, and that share will expand further in the coming years, eMarketer predicts.

Not every tablet owner buys via their device, however. As with ecommerce generally, there are more tablet shoppers—i.e., those who browse and research—than those who complete purchases on a tablet. eMarketer forecasts there will be 71.1 million US mobile buyers using a tablet in 2013, compared with 94.8 million US mobile shoppers using the device. That translates to 63% and 84% of all US tablet users, respectively.

###Retail and Mobile
For the apparel industry, the trend toward smartphones and tablets as the devices of choice is on an inevitable rise. Although mobile doesn’t create as much sales revenue as desktop for apparel, it’s growing faster by far, according to MarketLive. While smartphones drove a greater percentage of *traffic* than tablets did in Q3 2012 and 2013, tablets were responsible for more than *triple* the revenue.

A deeper dive into overall retail ecommerce metrics supports the assertion that desktop orders—though overwhelmingly ahead of mobile devices—is stagnant and shrinking compared to tablets and smartphones.

When it comes to overall conversion rates, tablets performed on par with traditional ecommerce in Q2 2013, at about 2.5%, but more than two-and-a-half times better than smartphones, according to Monetate findings.

Conversion rates don’t always show the full picture, however. Aki Aida, head of mobile at Zappos.com, the online retailer best known for footwear, said customers are spending more time researching on tablets than they do on smartphones or via desktop computers. “People [using tablets are often] watching TV or sitting at home and leisurely looking at products, whereas those who use desktops and even smartphones have an idea of what they want to purchase, and they want something quickly. There are definitely different behaviors,” he said.


###Retailers and responsive design

This shift is creating an industry environment where responsive design is increasingly key to maintaining a competitive edge.

The benefits of responsive design—a single code base, unified URL, and behavior that adapts to any device—may overshadow some liabilities such as longer load times or sub-optimal user experiences.

The tablet checkout process, for instance, has been a hindrance to greater ecommerce conversion. While inconsistency in site experience between tablets and ecommerce sites was the leading reason why tablet owners surveyed by shopping search engine TheFind in March 2013 said tablets were not their preferred online shopping device, checkout issues was the second-highest reason, cited by more than one-third of respondents.  These concerns are not unfounded. In an L2 Think Tank survey, only 21% of retailers had one-page checkouts on their tablet sites, and just 10% let buyers complete purchases within an app.

Even if responsive design is more scalable long-term, there are many reasons why not everyone has been clamoring to implement the technique. The upfront costs may be a hindrance, and can be about 25% more than a standard site design.

Page-load speed is also an important consideration when thinking about responsive design for a commerce site. A delay of as little as 1 second can cause shoppers to flee.
