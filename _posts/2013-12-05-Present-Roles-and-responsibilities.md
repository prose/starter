### Limited intra-group knowledge sharing  
With its origins in the catalog business, {{site.client.name}} has historically followed a publishing model. Although this was a natural evolution of print-to-web, in a multi-platform ecosystem new paradigms and redefinitions of roles and responsibilities need to be identified. One paradigm {{site.client.name}} should consider is the Flexible Team model.

Recently, both print and digital teams have been structurally merged. Although core competencies are remarkably strong, the vertical skill sets can be better socialized within the groups, which is an important step on the road to flexible design frameworks. This cross-disciplinary sharing and collaboration is critical to enable richer digital design work. 

>As we design more complex work, we need to integrate our skills better to have an omni-channel lens that can go across digital and offline designs


In the writing teams for example, there are great opportunities to learn from within in how to tell engaging product and brand stories, while also understanding how to write structural SEO copy. Similarly, in design teams, there are cross-pollinating opportunities between designing pixel perfect layouts, while also understanding the ins and outs of flexible digital grid design. 

>We are very data focused. But we need help in integrating other discipline skills so we can create a lively, human side to our experience


The goal is to get all teams to have skills that can go into deep vertical specializations while also building broad collaborative aspects.  That way, when Flexible Team structures are in place, disciplines can leverage each other’s expertise to build compelling digital work.

### Content teams are not unified
Currently, there are some concerns at two levels. At the process level, content
creation workflows are not streamlined or are developed on a project-by-project basis. Case in point is the utilization of the publishing waterfall method in digital projects. 

>Our content development process is not clear. It shows when we embark on new initiatives like tablet development


At the systems level, content is designed, managed and input into a highly customized, native grown CMS. The lack of a scalable and flexible CMS causes inefficiencies like handcrafting CSS for content or campaign experiences. There are also unclear responsibilities between content planning and copy writing. At Fluid, we recommend that a content workflow foundation has to be firmly established before a Flexible Team and process model can function.

### Lack of UX resources
At {{site.client.name}}, the UX role is limited in capability, scale and scope. The role has to evolve and mature as it’s often a catalyst for process change between the design, build and marketing teams. In organizations similar to {{site.client.name}}’s size and type, there is typically a range of skillsets within UX that include traditional information architecture, visual design and, increasingly, front-end code prototyping.

>We don't separate the presentation layer from content in many of our roles and
responsibilities. UX should be part of the creative process from the beginning.

Further, at {{site.client.name}}, the UX role can be unclear, with responsibilities shifting across project types. On some projects, for example, business analysts specify wireframes and functionality, while on others, designers annotate and design wireframes.
