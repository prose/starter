Throughout the stakeholder interviews, and across departments, we observed the following issues that—if not addressed—will impede a successful transition to working in responsive design.

### Pixel Perfect Expectations

>The issue for us in moving to responsive design will be not spending time on perfecting everything for every customer.

Unlike print, the web doesn't allow anyone to have complete control over the final presentation of content. In a multi-platform ecosystem in particular, the best that brands can aim for is designs that are rendered as fully as possible on every imaginable platform.

As with many brands that began in the print catalog business, the culture at {{site.client.name}} continue to hold onto outdated expectations of what can be controlled from a visual perspective. As an example, image assets are still used in places on the site where suitable CSS alternatives exist.

### Lack of Templates

>Our homepage is not a template – it gets custom built every time.

>The Creative team is working purely from a design-driven perspective, ie; not managing to the grid. Working from a grid for the tablet project was a scary thing for Creative because they always want maximum flexibility.


Complete freedom in page layout and design may keep a site looking fresh, but it frequently requires massive effort on the part of the development team to implement. For responsive sites in particular, every new layout must be built and tested on a whole library of devices and browsers.

### Ineffectual Style Guide

>There is no standard style guide that is adhered to here. No one is checking brand guidelines.

>Even though we’re a perfectionist culture, we still make many design mistakes—like having four different navigation structures.

>Setting guidelines and following them is a challenge. For instance, there is no process today even to approve how buttons appear.

Unlike print, web style guides should function as living documents that require constant updates and evolution. {{site.client.name}} has outgrown the existing style guide, and the options presented in it are too limited to support the shifting demands of digital design. Additionally, the form of the style guide doesn't meet the current needs of the company. It provides only limited styles for fundamental elements like buttons and pull quotes, and is not part of more cohesive design system.

### Unclear Requirements

>If a baseline standard doesn’t exist, working in responsive design will be incredibly difficult.

To the best of our knowledge, the Business Analysis team has not defined a clear list of preferred devices that should be supported. Because the site hasn’t been constructed in a way that allows [progressive enhancement](/Appendix-Glossary#progressiveEnhancement), the Development team must spend a disproportionate amount of their time supporting browsers that may not be worth the revenue. Additionally, the code needed to support these less-used browsers is negatively impacting the experience of users on more popular browsers because of code bloat.
