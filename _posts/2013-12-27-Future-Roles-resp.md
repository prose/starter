### Fluid Recommends:

Although {{site.client.name}} has made great progress in evolving from a “print only” culture to cross-trained digital and print approach, additional refinements are necessary to become a fully agile organization that can support flexible design frameworks.

### Programs and Activities
One helpful way to begin this evolution is to consider a Flexible Team approach. To get to a Flexible Team approach, following is a tactical roadmap that will bring various teams towards the goal:

<table class="future-roles">
<tr id="initiateSkills">
	<td>
		<h4>Initiate Skills Sharing and Integration program</h4>
		Activity: Program Development
		<br>
		Impact: All teams
		<br>
		Lead: Design team leaders
	</td>
	<td>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Jumpstart knowledge immersion with speakers that are at the forefront of digital workflows and tactics
			</li>
			<li>
				Consider highly motivational yet practical events like PopTech or An Event Apart
			</li>
			<li>
				Conduct brown bag lunches or roundtable sessions with your vendors or design partners to share various disciplinary case studies and approaches
			</li>
			<li>
				Select small contained projects to experiment with an integrated core team concept
			</li>
		</ul>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr id="contentTaskforce">
	<td>
		<h4>Develop a Content Taskforce</h4>
		Activity: Task force<br />
		Impact: Copy, Systems and Content teams<br />
		Lead: Technical and Content leaders
	</td>
	<td>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A CMS team to oversee evaluation and structure a solution
			</li>
			<li>
				A content group to analyze gaps in the content workflow, and start structuring core modules and templates in preparation for the new CMS.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr id="augmentUX">
	<td>
		<h4>Augment UX roles</h4>
		Activity: Staff augmentation and development<br />
		Impact: UX and BA teams<br />
		Lead: UX and BA leaders
	</td>
	<td>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Role definition exercise: IA, UX, Solution Architect, BA
			</li>
			<li>
				Make UX part of the core team process from the beginning of each project
			</li>
			<li>
				Consider staff augmentation with IA (Systems Dev experience), Design-UX (prototyping and front-end design skills) and BA (ability to write informal and formal documentation processes) 
			</li>
			<li>
				Use a contained project, for example RWD email campaigns (small) personalization program (large), to tactically work out the role definitions and advance methodologies
			</li>
		</ul>
	</td>
</tr>
</table>

	

### Flexible Team Models
When these tactics are in place, {{site.client.name}} can start experimenting with Flexible Team models. These are multi-disciplinary structures that are formed to adapt to a project’s needs. The goal is to identify the most efficient set of resources for the right kinds of project.  At {{site.client.name}}, these Flexible Teams can look like these: 

<h4>Flexible Team One, Small-Scale: Landing or Campaign Experiences</h4>
![redesignTeam]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/roles/small-scale.png)

<table class="flexible-team">
	<tr>
		<td class="current-col">Current</td>
		<td class="evolving-col">Evolving</td>
		<td class="new-col">New</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Developer</b><br />
			Current role but now included as part of Flexible Team 1
		</td>
		<td>
			<b>Designer or Copywriter</b><br />
			A small project can be staffed by either role, with the UX as pivot
		</td>
		<td>
			<b>User Experience</b><br />
			Design-based role that can also pivot with designer for cross-disciplinary learnings
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>





<h4>Flexible Team Two, Medium-Scale: Application Development</h4>
![redesignTeam]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/roles/medium-scale.png)
<table class="flexible-team">
	<tr>
		<td class="current-col">Current</td>
		<td class="evolving-col">Evolving</td>
		<td class="new-col">New</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Content manager</b><br />
				Current role but now be part of core to pivot and partner with creative roles<br />
			<b>Developer</b><br />
				Current role but now included as part of Flex Team 3<br />
			<b>QA Manager</b><br />
				Current role but now included as part of Flex Team 3
		</td>
		<td>
			<b>Designer Digital</b><br />
				Evolve role to be strategically placed for these type of projects<br />
			<b>Business Analyst</b><br />
				Evolve focus on more creative or visual methods to enable rapid sketching and prototyping<br />
			<b>Project Manager</b><br />
				Evolve and expand delivery method and process that has Lean UX or informal scrum principles	
		</td>
		<td>
			<b>User Experience</b><br />
				Design or IA-based role that is a catalyst to the BA and designer roles<br />
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h4>Flexible Team Three, Large-Scale: Platform Redesign and Integration</h4>
![redesignTeam]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/roles/large-scale.png)
<table class="flexible-team">
	<tr>
		<td class="current-col">Current</td>
		<td class="evolving-col">Evolving</td>
		<td class="new-col">New</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Developer</b><br />  
			Current role but now included as part of Flexible Team 2<br />
			<b>QA Manager</b>

		</td>
		<td><b>Designer Digital, Senior Role</b><br />
			Evolve role to be strategically placed and lead for these type of projects<br />
			<b>Content Strategist</b>
			Evolve from content or writing teams to focus on content classification, taxonomy, structural development and management<br />
			<b>Project Manager</b>
			Evolve and expand delivery method and process that incorporates Lean UX, scrum, and waterfall methods	
		</td>
		<td><b>User Experience, Senior Role</b><br />
			IA-based role that plays partner to the BA and solutions architect roles. both will heavy lift on requirements, formal use cases, rapid prototyping, functional documentation.<br />
			<b>Solutions Architect</b>
			Platform integration workflows, an internal systems integrator (SI) role to help shape design into platform.
