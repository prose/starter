				Activity: Process management
				Impact: All teams, Project Management
				Lead: UX and PM
		</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>
					UX and PM to design a prototype immersion program
				</li>
				<li>
					Discuss and illustrate with case studies than can also include {{site.client.name}}’s service partners
				</li>
				<li>
					Discover themes and tools for example in rapid prototyping, Lean UX principles in product design methodology, Integration points between UX and design toolkits

			<h4>Develop a dynamic Digital Reference Guide</h4>
			Activity: Application Development and Process Management
			Impact: Design, UX and Development teams
			Lead: All Team leaders
		</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Start a dynamic extranet that contains template and pattern/component libraries Digital Reference Guide in phases, with emphasis on patterns and components 
				</li>
				<li>
					As the Guide becomes more advance, patterns and components can be rapidly deployed across projects for rapid prototyping activities
				</li>
				<li>
					These beta-release patterns can be road tested on contained digital projects (for example buy flow, account management)
				</li>

			<h4>Enforcing Systematic Design Principles </h4>
			Activity: Work Analysis
			Impact: All, Project Management
			Lead: BA, PM leads
		</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Structure a small task force to identify current project types, build complexities, and resourcing
				</li>
				<li>
					Evaluate themes (progressive design, requirements gathering) as well as methodology used for each project type
				</li>
				<li>
					The goal is to develop a flexible process model to solve project types efficiently using a core team model
