read [the holographic universe by michael talbot][1]  \
climb [5.14][2]  \
reflect on how [john lennon][3] was an [abusive husband][4]  \
who [publicly condemned himself][5] for those attitudes and actions at the height of his fame   \
not so dissimilar to picasso  \
  \
think about it  \
then think about it again
