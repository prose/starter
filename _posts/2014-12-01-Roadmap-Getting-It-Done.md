Rather than tackle a wholesale reorganization, {{site.client.name}} will be better served to “divide and conquer” by breaking the effort into different elements such as People, Process, and Projects.  By marrying this approach with a staged approach from 3 months to 6-9 months to 9-12 months, the organization can safely allocate resources to enable this culture change while maintaining business as usual. 

<p>A roadmap for stabilizing, optimizing, and activating people, processes and projects.</p>

### Summary  
Through this engagement, Fluid has identified where evolution, growth and culture change are necessary to fully prepare the digital teams to work in a responsive design framework.

By addressing such staffing and role definition issues as intra-group knowledge sharing, unifying content teams and securing and empowering appropriate UX resources, {{site.client.name}} will be better prepared to move toward responsive design and function as a more agile organization.

From a culture perspective, this means that pixel-perfect expectations need to be adjusted in favor of optimal customer experiences on the maximum number of devices. And more rigor needs to be applied to develop, maintain and respect robust business requirements, a template library and a scalable digital reference guide.

Change is never easy. But without evolution, {{site.client.name}} risks losing its competitive edge and foresaking the next generation of loyal customers. In a multi-platform world, the true meaning of "the customer is always right" has changed. {{site.client.name}} needs to change with it.
