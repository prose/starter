We reviewed recent Fluid projects that had a responsive design component for insights into what processes worked best when applied in the context of actual design engagements.

**Collaborative core teams **  
Organizing people into a small, autonomous and collaborative "core team" is helpful in getting UI experiences and features right from the beginning. For UI feature work like module development, a team might be as small as 3-4 people with a front end developer, visual designer and user experience designer (plus a project manager.) This team might be augmented by a systems architect when integrating APIs or other systems. Daily meetings to review and discuss wireframes, Photoshop comps or HTML prototypes ensure that everyone stays on the same page.

Core teams should form at the very beginning of the project, during the early stages of wireframe development. It is critical to include the front end developer at the beginning so UI patterns determined in collaboration with UX and Visual Design can be proved out via discussion and prototyping. This cuts down on lost time revisiting the design later in the project.

**Design "mobile first" to speed development and drive most critical features **  
Adopting the mobile first approach - even if it means an investment of more time upfront for UX Design to generate the mobile content - can be worth it. This is because moving from smaller viewports up into larger ones is faster and easier than the other way around. Designing for mobile first has the added benefit of forcing the UX designer to focus on the most critical features by virtue of the limits of real estate and bandwidth on mobile.

**Prototyping behaviors **  
Prototyping behaviors within the core team is the best way to quickly prove out a UX designer’s concept or help a Visual Designer understand what is possible. These kinds of prototypes can help determine breakpoints, visualize responsive grid patterns, aid in designing menu systems across various device types, and test experiences on different devices or on touch-enabled versus non-touch (mouse and keyboard) devices. The prototyping environment can be as simple as a Linux server running Apache.
