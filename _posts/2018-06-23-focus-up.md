<span class='date' style='float:right;'>*watercolor, ink*</span>

the city stops for industry  
(nothing)
never not a murder scene  
(something)  
press ctrl in grey and green  
(feeling)  
they say wash  
(mean)  
but need to clean  
(
this reality  
wants more realer things  
than screaming screens and sidewalk scenes
the pain of possibility  
find out who you want to be  
align and live the in between  
follow your own light 
shine clean  
push on and see
