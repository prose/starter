>tacky poems  
bout sadder things  
may keep someone  
on the scene  
kill for them or  
let them kill me  
you can reject duality  
  
we pick three  

>the city stops for industry  
(nothing)  
never not a murder scene  
(something)  
press ctrl in grey and green  
(feeling)  
they say wash  
(mean)  
but need to clean  
(bleeding)  
this reality  
(seething)  
wants more realer things  
(reasons)  
than screaming screens and sidewalk scenes  
(believing)  

>the pain of possibility  
find out who you really be  
align and live the in between  
follow your own light  
shine clean  
push on and see  

>(divine being)
