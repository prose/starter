tacky poems  
bout sadder things  
may keep someone  
on the scene  
kill for them  
let them kill me  
reject duality  
we pick three  


the city stops for industry  
(nothing)  
never not a murder scene  
(something)  
press ctrl in grey and green  
(feeling)  
they say wash  
(mean)  
but need to clean  
(bleeding)  
this reality  
(seething)  
wants more realer things  
(reasons)  
than screaming screens and sidewalk scenes  
(believing)  
the pain of possibility  
(seeing)  
find out who you really be  
(sing)  
align and live the in between  
(breathing)  
follow your own light 
(leading)  
shine clean  
(freeing)  
push on and see  
(divine being)
