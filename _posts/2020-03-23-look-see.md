meaner than  
your mom is  
as hard as possibility   
pythagoras spouts spiritually  
about definite infinity  
asked bout angels  
and got angles  
see a number  
and he know thats me  
listen glisten  
know its never  
really missing  
when you within  
this reality  
cool cucumber  
veggie green that  
foliage is whats  
real to me  
run with you brother  
construct you fucked  
we indistinguishable  
one not other  
its you from me  
so why you i  
and hawaii  
cant breathe  
yall false dieties  
bout that land sieze  
leave you spent  
dry heave  
wheeze and plus  
they gave him  
broken knees  
white rabbits  
but colored antifreeze  
who says you  
but um common dude  
your thoughts manifested  
they could change the way we do it  
or just come across crudely  
low light, slow  
pack n light your soul  
and you gotta see skull    
spark n flare oh my  
eventually, its meant to be  
perspective
we're the dust we breathe
