>meaner than  
your mom is    
as hard as possibility   
pythagoras spouts spiritually  
bouts of infinite divinity  
worked on angles  
but got angels  
sometimes its that    
believe and breathe  
all you knead  
know that we    
listen glean glisten   
now its never  
really missing  
if we fed have time to sit  
gracious tidings blessed be  
we love this reality  
it got to be  
what's hot to me  
cooler cucumber  
veggie green scene be  
what trees see is whats  
real to me  
rider on that b  
if you fuck with my people  
waters birds fallen trees
you separate and see  
what subjective reality  
should've sent it coming
you been told   
there's no i in breathe  
fragile construct gets    
crumpled up what    
y'all can kill each other  
we split that scene    
been under cover  
indistinguishable  
we one not other  
see it obviously  
you from me so why you me  
and hawai'i cant breathe  
yall false deities  
down with land seize  
that slave squeeze  
what save means (what save means?!)  
end yo slave dreams  
leave you spent  
dry heave big flame burnin  
wheeze and plus  
they gave him  
broken knees  
white rabbits  
but colored antifreeze  
heard him say thank you, please  
who says you  
about them too?  
spot it an we dodge it  
manifest your thoughts    
we hear you      
come across crude  
pretty words isnt true  
what's rude  
saw them comin out the blue  
stay up.  
truth shines bright  
fast as light is you  
low, slow, clean. go.  
lern to skirt the conflict  
while you pack n light your soul  
see skull by mole garden  
we bloom grow  
fractal-like from atom  
with a holographic soul  
yo  
roots and leaves  
from your ancestry  
is the dust we breathe  
but you already know
