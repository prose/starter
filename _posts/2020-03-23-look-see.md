>meaner than  
your mom is    
as hard as possibility   
pythagoras spouts spiritually  
bouts of definite infinity  
asking bout angels  
but got angles  
see a number  
believe and breathe  
all you knead  
you know that we    
listen glisten   
how its never  
really missing  
when you within  
this reality  
it got to be  
cooler cucumber  
veggie green that  
foliage is whats  
real to me  
run with your brother  
no bother  
if you bother  
but separate and see  
subjective reality  
there's no i in breathe  
build a construct  
you crumbled n fucked    
y'all kill each other  
dont bother we  
indistinguishable  
one not other  
really quite obviously  
it you from me  
so why you, me  
and hawai'i  
cant breathe  
yall false deities  
bout that land seize  
that slave squeeze  
what save means (what save means?!)  
leave you spent  
dry heave  
wheeze and plus  
they gave him  
broken knees  
white rabbits  
but colored antifreeze  
who says you  
but meant them too     
let your thoughts manifest  
wanna hear if it true      
let em come across crude  
pretty words isnt true  
so what's rude  
stay up.  
preach that truth  
low light, slow  
keep clean.  
go.  
lern to skirt the conflict  
while you  
pack n light your soul  
see skull  
by mole  
we garden, grow  
fractal-like from atom  
with a holographic soul  
yo  
roots and trees  
and your ancestry  
is the dust we breathe  
kinda thought that you should know
