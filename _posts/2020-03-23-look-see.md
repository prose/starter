meaner than  
your mom is  
as hard as possibility   
pythagoras spouts spiritually  
about definite infinity  
asked bout angels  
and got angles  
see a number  
and he know thats me  
listen glisten  
know its never  
really missing 
this reality  
cool cucumber  
run with you brother  
construct you fucked  
we indistinguishable  
one not other  
its you from me  
so why you i  
and hawaii  
cant breathe  
yall false dieties  
bout that land sieze  
leave you spent  
dry heave  
broken knees  
white rabbits  
but colored antifreeze  
who says you  
blaze reality  
low light, slow  
and you gotta see  
spark n flare oh  
perspective, what there is to see
