>meaner than  
your mom is    
as hard as possibility   
pythagoras spouts spiritually  
bouts of definite infinity  
asking bout angels  
but got angles  
see a number  
believe and breathe  
all you knead  
you know thats we    
listen glisten   
how its never  
really missing  
when you within  
this reality  
its got to be  
cooler cucumber  
veggie green that  
foliage is whats  
real to me  
run with you brother  
no bother  
if you bother  
but separate and see  
construct you fucked  
kill each other  
but it dont bother me  
we indistinguishable  
one not other  
obviously  
its you from me  
so why you i  
and hawaii  
cant breathe  
yall false dieties  
bout that land sieze  
that slave squeze  
what save means  
leave you spent  
dry heave  
wheeze and plus  
they gave him  
broken knees  
white rabbits  
but colored antifreeze  
who says you  
but they means me    
let your thoughts manifest  
they could change the way we do  
let em come across crude  
stay up.  
preach it dude  
low light, slow  
never rude.  
go.  
pack n light your soul  
see skull  
be mole  
garden, grow  
fractal like from atom  
holographic soul  
roots and trees  
and your ancestry  
its the dust we breathe  
thought that you should know
