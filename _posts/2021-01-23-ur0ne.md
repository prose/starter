>no martin luthor just kings  
not a drop of christ blood in my being  
raised by a bishop, was once anointed priest  
in a place where color defined a false reality  
black and white and red, stage props an everything  
  
>said x marks the spot and gave a map to me  
born colorblind and so all we see is green  
can’t spot the forest for the trees, gotta sneeze  
raised out west, where its what you nat see  
where them n’s run deep 3 m generations be  
  
>bring us to an intersection,  
moment with a lot of means  
recognize its 1937 on frankfurt’s streets  
1888 westward murder scene,  
1791 talkin abolish slavery  
listen real close,  
check out some book reading  
time to get it straight bout how you feel things    
  
>it’s all right now, look back to chemistry  
not a law of man, but a law - so it seems  
you really can’t ever destroy an energy  
transmutate a healthy outlet  
or watch it explode and scream    
  
>who really steals things?  
who’s in charge and who’s appealing  
top from the bottom kinda how they been feeling  
maybe self abuse is kinda how they been dealing  
digging clams tides out.   
is that looting, murder, stealing?  
unchecked social wreck needs support  
his sign said "kill me"    
  
>doom say he pity fools  
don study they history  
if you don’t know, you gon be told.  
on that really fo real speak  
love to all my mothers sisters  
lovers brothers an those other things  
sovereignty ya’ll  
get up, stay up now its happening  
the only thing we know  
its responsive responsibility  
the only truth we bring   
everyone is god and king  
  
>all and only love  
no separation what we sing  
i and i and i that’s we  
and watered grass is green  
when they say two,  
look a little harder see three  
your failure to reject  
or suspect the duality  
makes it much easier for them  
to construct you reality   
  
>nothing stays hidden,  
get up yall come out and see  
stand up stay up together  
it’s we best believe  
oh its a big dragon  
ditch draggin got him on his knees  
fire breathin tail waggin  
and he beggin sir mercy please  
killer smile and time for action  
roll my eyes and watch em squeeze  
  
>clean slate, a clear slab and  
talkin bout no more monarchies  
can’t kill hydra but we  
see clearly
will bury your hatchet  
with clear ease, say please  
an they won’t stop tryin  
but we spring back elastic  
saplings slap a knee its happening  
finally breathe deep  
gaslight yo whole life an yet  
they nothin without us an trees  
time to spin that frown around  
come down from the hills to town an seas    
  
>all the people buzzin now  
and they comin out the clouds  
stay easy with the breeze  
not so afraid to look around  
or bout whats beneath the ground  
an trippin round yo feet  
no more fear of zombie town  
or never breathin once you down  
they pave roads with souls now like beneath  
sing and hear to the sound  
abolish narcissism now  
stop throwing life preservers wow  
you know they kneel pretend to drown
  
>do it how you do it  
make sure its how you feel the truth is  
ain’t no one can push you through this  
but the spirit sayin dont miss    
while you cut off the cummerbund  
maybe appropriate some ape shit  
perhaps learn bout what you came with  
how white saviours really aint this  
turn performative pejorative  
figure out what it means and say it  
is you missin? did you listen?  
they will babble on its archaic  
its time to come together  
said that only we can save us
