>no martin luthor just kings
not a drop of christ blood in my being
raised by a bishop, was once anointed priest
in a place where color defined a false reality 
black and white and red, stage props an everything

said x marks the spot and gave a map to me
born colorblind and so all we see is green
can’t spot the forest for the trees, gotta sneeze
raised out west, where its what you nat see
where them n’s run deep 3 m generations be

bring us to an intersection, moment with a lot of means
recognize its 1937 on frankfurt’s streets
1888 westward murder scene, 1791 talkin abolish slavery
listen real close, check out some book reading
time to get it straight bout how you feel things

it’s all right now, look back to chemistry
not a law of man, but a law - so it seems
you really can’t ever destroy an energy
transmutate a healthy outlet
or watch it explode and scream

who really steals things?  who’s in charge and who’s appealing
top from the bottom kinda how they been feeling
maybe self abuse is kinda how they been dealing
digging clams tides out. that looting, murder, stealing?
unchecked social wreck needs support his sign said "kill me"

doom say he pity fools don study they history
if you don’t know, you gon be told.  is that really fo real speak
love to all my mothers sisters lovers brothers an other things
sovereignty ya’ll maybe we’ll all have a ball get along common let’s see
the only thing we know and it’s the only truth we bring 

everyone is god and king

all and only love no separation what we sing
i and i and i that’s we and watered grass is green
when they say two, look a little harder see three
your failure to reject or suspect the duality
makes it much easier for them to construct you reality

nothing stays hidden, get up yall come out and see
stand up stay up together it’s we best believe
oh its a big dragon ditch draggin got him on his knees
fire breathin tail waggin and he beggin sir mercy please
killer smile and time for action roll my eyes and watch em squeeze

clean slate, a clear slab and talkin bout no more monarchies 
can’t kill hydra but we’ll bury your hatchet with clear ease
an they won’t stop tryin but we spring back like elastic slap a knee
gaslight yo whole life an yet they nothin without us an trees
time to spin that frown around from the hills to downtown an seas

all the people buzzin now and they comin out the clouds with the breeze
no so afraid to look around or bout whats beneath the ground an yo feet
like no more fear of zombie town or never breathin once you down like beneath
sing and listen to the sound abolish narcissism now
maybe push em off the iceberg or it’s time for hog chow

do it how you do it but make sure its how you feel true
ain’t no one can push you to it but the spirit sayin do it
cut off the cummerbund, no slaves for anyone.  said fuck your royalty.
turn performative pejorative and while they babble on it seems
its time to come together cross out the christian hierarchy
