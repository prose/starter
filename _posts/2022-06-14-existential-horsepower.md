this comes from the title of a [podcast][1] interviewing [john long][2] on [the enormocast][3]  

working on solidifying this style of digital painting inspired by watercolor.  this allows me to use a pencil drawing as a rapid prototype and quickly iterate a final image using an ipad in about the same amount of time as a watercolor sketch  
  
this gif was put together in procreate

<!-- in this implementation the HTML <object> tag should allow *existential-horsepower.gif* to be rendered as a primary image, and default back to *existential-horsepower-web.gif* if that image cannot be used - cant tell if it works but it definitely puts the backup image there (6/14/22)  -->
