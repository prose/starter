couple of things
my father told to me
opinions are like assholes
everyones got one
most of ‘em stink
livin’ in the city
you gotta pay to breathe
and if you ask for help
probably do it on your knees
said you can work harder
than you thought what work could be
if you’re feeling tired
time to stop and breathe
sayin sorry has its place
try to live without the need
theres a time to shed a tear
a time to not be seen
end of the day 
what stands out to me
is always keep your cool
and never let em see you scream
