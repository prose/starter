>couple of things  
my father told to me  
opinions are like assholes  
everyones got 'em  
they mostly stink  
livin’ in the city  
you gotta pay to breathe  
and if you ask for help  
probably do it on your knees  
said you can work harder  
than you thought what work could be  
and if you’re feeling tired  
yeah its time to stop and breathe  
sayin sorry has its place  
try to live without the need  
best learn the first time  
way less embarrassing  
whining isn't worth a thing  
just focus on what's happening  
every curse you give comes back  
sticks and glue from elementary  
theres a time to shed a tear  
a time to not be seen  
end of the day  
what stands out to me  
is always keep it cool  
never let em see you scream
