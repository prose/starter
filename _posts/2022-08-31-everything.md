everything  
in this reality  
  
is  
  
attitude   
perception   
posture   
  
set  
setting   
fractal  
  
your lifetime  
is   
one big trip  
  
as real as reality  
as real as you let it be  
more serious than life or death   
  
both  
  
neither   
  
breathe  
  
you are the earth  
your body belongs to the earth   
love yourself   
heal  
be whole   

time   
is a construct  
all that is   
is now  
the space between thoughts  
is real  

in between  
you will find  
everything  
infinity  
space  
  
in the song of the universe  
you will find light  
  
light as prisoner  
ends in  
death of earth   
   
raven was just playing   
doing as was shown   
shiny trinket mountain    
castle of a home  
fat and happy  
preened and fluffed   
betchu couldnt steal the sun  
quick side eye  
flap  
gust  
didnâ€™t take too much  

misguided mercury    
dont slow down to think   
heels on fire   
lit the pyre   
brought us to the brink
