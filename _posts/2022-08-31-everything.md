everything 
in this reality 
is
attitude 
perception 
posture 
set
setting 
fractal

your lifetime 
is
one big trip

as real as reality
as real as you let it be
more serious than life or death 

both

neither 

breathe

you are the earth
your body belongs to the earth 
love yourself 
heal
be whole 

time 
is a construct
all that is 
is now
the space between thoughts 
is real 

in between 
you will find 
everything 
infinity
space 

in the song of the universe 
you will find light

light as prisoner
ends in
death of earth 

raven was just playing 
doing as was shown
shiny trinket mountain 
castle of a home
fat and happy
preened and fluffed 
betchu couldnt steal the sun
quick side eye
flap
gust
didnâ€™t take too much

misguided mercury 
dont slow down to think 
heels on fire
lit the pyre
brought us to the brink
