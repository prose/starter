we want to laugh  
we want to dream  
we want to live  
we all the king of kings  
  
inside of we  
is everything  
together we sing  
see new happenings  
  
imagine things  
share what you think  
hold these thoughts closer  
time to plant the seed  
  
how will we grow now    
our reality  
when we burn the brightest  
everything is green  
  
blossoms drift down the stream  
floating everyones dream  
tell them what does it mean  
live revolution and be  
  
as a people we sing  
like the children can see  
what could we be  
clear the path for new things  
  
burn everything  
thatâ€™s not for we   
re-finding  
what it means to be free  
  
this time is for we  
no more false liberty  
together we fight  
for old growth and new seeds  
  
what do you see  
how do you dream  
we here together   
we king of king  
  
shine and be free  
laugh love and dream  
live life just like you meant to be  
    
mind what you think  
thoughts shape everything  
holographic dream   
its a live fractal scene  
  
a little thing learn to glean  
how to shine and just be  
see everything is everything  
you and me are just we  
equal beings be sharing things
  
see what we been    
leader to fiend  
re-re-learned bout how they never a friend   
  
probably follow neither  
head to where its greener  
your greatest power  
change the channel to ether  
say no split the scene    
know you can just leave  
but best do you part  
or we all be defeated  
  
the anger is needed  
transmutation succeeded  
we flying at speed    
bark n nip at our feet  
let them have each other  
it's our time to eat    
  
where you relate   
you resonate  
time find a place  
we nothing but space  
      
so slow hear the stars   
singing out from afar  
show the way brilliant spiraling arc   
light thru the dark to your heart  
  
back to the start  
stardust with nuclear parts  
feel yourself vibing higher  
rise up open your heart  
  
you a king and a star  
learn who you are  
shine for each other  
and blow on the spark  
  
time for this fire to start
