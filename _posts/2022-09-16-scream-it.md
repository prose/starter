we want to laugh  
we want to dream  
we want to live all like the king of kings  
  
inside of we  
is everything  
together we be  
make new happenings  
  
imagine things  
share what you see  
hold these thoughts closer  
time to plant the seed  
  
how will we grow now    
our reality  
  
what do we need  
to set the land free  
blossom drift down the stream  
everyones dream  
it's your freedom happening  
tell them what does it mean
time to be king
close your eyes an  
see it like the silver screen  
  
as a people we sing  
like the children can see  
what could we be  
without death nothing is green  
  
burn everything  
that’s not for we   
re-finding  
what it means to be free  
  
this time is for we  
no more false liberty  
together we fight  
for old growth and new seeds  
  
what do you see  
how do you dream  
we here together   
we king of king  
  
shine and be free  
laugh love and dream  
live life just like you meant to be  
  
get outside and just breathe  
live laugh shine and sing  
everyday dream your new reality  
  
mind what you think  
thoughts shape everything  
your holographic dream   
this is a live fractal scene  
  
what have we been  
from leader to fiend  
learned they never a friend 
when it’s just about them  
  
probably follow neither  
head to where its greener  
your greatest power  
to channel the ether
say no change the scene    
don’t make you mean     
the anger is needed  
transmutation succeeded  
  
we flying away  
they as good as defeated  
  
where you relate   
you resonate  
a place just for you  
we nothing but space
    
the universe tool   
an nobody’s fool   
get feeling gracious
nows not too late fo' this  
  
go slow hear the stars  
sing out from afar  
show the way   
thru dark to your heart  
  
back to the start  
stardust from nuclear parts  
when it’s vibing higher  
open your heart  
  
you a king and a star  
learn who you are  
shine for each other  
and blow on the spark  
  
time for this fire to start
