we want to laugh  
we want to dream  
we want to live  
we are all king of kings  
  
inside of we  
is everything  
together we sing  
see new happenings  
  
imagine things  
say what you think  
hold these thoughts closer  
time to plant the seed  
  
how will we grow now    
our reality  
when we burn the brightest  
everything is green  
  
blossoms drift down the stream  
floating universe dreams  
we all teach together    
tear down fences and be  
  
as a people we sing  
the children can see  
tell yourself it's on me  
clear the path for new things  
  
burn everything  
nothing is just for me   
re-finding defining  
what it means to be free   
  
this time is for we  
no more false liberty  
together we fight  
for old growth and new seeds  
  
what do you see  
how do you dream  
we here together   
we kings of king  
  
shine and be free  
laugh love and dream  
live life out  
like you meant to be  
    
mind what you think  
thoughts shape everything  
holographic dream   
live fractal scene  
  
so shine and just be  
see everything is everything  
i and i is we  
equal beings be sharing things  
  
see what we been    
leader to fiend  
never again  
we know they never a frien   
  
we follow we  
way up high with some trees  
your greatest power  
move your feet and just leave  
  
say no split the scene      
but best do you part  
way back in the temples   
that's where slavery start   
   
the anger is needed  
transmutation succeeded  
let them have each other  
it's our time to eat    
  
where you relate   
you resonate  
time find a place  
we nothing but space  
      
so slow hear the stars   
singing out from afar  
shine the way through the dark
spiral arc to your heart  
  
back to the start  
stardust with nuclear parts  
feel yourself moving higher  
rise up an light your fire  
  
you a king and a star  
learn who you are  
shine for each other  
and blow on the spark  
  
weve been there from the start
step up open your heart
