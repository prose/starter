we want to laugh  
we want to dream  
we want to live all like the king of kings  
  
inside of we  
is everything  
together we be  
like new happenings  
  
imagine things what you see  
hold these thoughts closer  
time to plant the seed  
how will you grow now  
  
your reality  
  
what do we need  
to set the land free  
fish in the stream  
everyones dream  
happening  
seen it like the silver screen  
  
as a people we sing  
like the children can see  
what could we be  
without death nothing is green  
  
burn everything  
that’s not for we   
re-finding  
what it means to be free  
  
this time is for we  
no more false liberty  
together we fight  
for old growth and new seeds  
  
what do you see  
how do you dream  
we here together   
we king of king  
  
shine and be free  
laugh love and dream  
living life just like you meant to be  
  
get outside and just breathe  
live laugh shine and sing  
everyday dream your reality  
  
mind what you think  
thoughts shape everything  
your holographic dream   
is a live fractal scene  
  
what have we been  
from leader to fiend  
never a friend if it’s about them  
  
probably follow neither  
head to where its greener  
your greatest power  
say no and change the scene    
that don’t make you mean     
the anger is needed  
turn it into wings  
transmutation succeeded  
  
where you relate   
you resonated  
space for you  
out where yo place is  
    
the universe tool   
ain’t nobody’s fool   
its the time is    
now is not too late   
fo us   
  
do you hear the stars  
singing out from afar  
show the way   
around the world to your heart  
  
back to the start  
stardust we depart  
if it’s vibing higher  
just open your heart  
  
you a king and a star  
don’t forget who you are  
shine for each other  
and blow on the spark  
  
time for this fire to start
