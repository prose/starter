Here's how to get started with Poole.

## Login with your Github User

It was challenging, but Poole supports OAuth. I think it's very important to use OAuth over Basic Authentication, since Github data can be very sensible and no one wants to risk getting his password sniffed.aaa

## Browse Repositories

This is the landing page, it gives you all the repositories you have access to. If a Jekyll site has multiple branches, you are prompted to select your desired branch, otherwise, you jump into the repo directly. **lkj**

## Browsing Posts

Once you have selected a repository, you can browse your posts and sub-folders in a traditional file-browser-ish manner. You can create new files here as well, which immediately opens an empty document for you, which you can save after populating it with some text.

## Edit Posts

We use CodeMirror, a great software that makes browser-based editing a pleasure (the first time). Compared to a regular textarea, which has an annoying inline scoller this is a huge step forward I think.

## Preview

You can instantly preview your writing by either clicking the preview icon at the document menu bar, or use that fance keyboard combo ctrl\+shift\+p to toggle Preview on and off.

## Publish

Once you are ready, you can easily publish your article, which lets it show up on the actual webpage/blog.

## Metadata

Take full control about your post, and edit Metadata aka the YAML frontmatter. No limitations.
