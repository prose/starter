Missing your court date is a serious offense.

Please call us as soon as possible at (404) 658-6940 to arrange a new court date. You may be charged an FTA fee for missing your original court date. If you have a valid medical excuse, bring evidence to your new court date to have the fee removed.

### At Court

## What should I do on my court date?

*Arrive early.* You should plan to arrive early for your case to compensate for any unexpected delays. Once you arrive in court, you will pass through a mandatory security check before being allowed to enter.

*Identify your court room.* To locate the court room where you case will be heard, find the defendant's name on one of the information screens in the main lobby. You can also ask at the information windows located in the main lobby. 

*Proceed to your courtroom.* Courtrooms are located on the 1st (one floor down from the entrance), 3rd, 5th and 6th floors. Elevators are located to the left of the information windows in the main lobby. There is also a staircase near the security station in the main lobby.

*Check in with courtroom staff.* Each courtroom has staff that can give you more information about your case. Check in with them to learn more about what will be required of you. Be advised that court staff, solicitors and the Judge cannot give you legal advice. Please consult an attorney if you have a legal question regarding your case.

## What are the possible outcomes of my case?

If you enter a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea you will be required to satisfy the ruling of the court. This may include paying a fine. Some offenses can also result in jail time, including mandatory jail time under certain circumstances. 

If found not guilty after trial your case is closed. 

Your case may also be reset for a future date.

### After Court

## <a name="fta"></a>  What happens if my license is suspended because of a Failure to Appear (FTA)?

You will need to appear in court to clear your FTA. After disposition of your case, you will need a 912 form to take to the Department of Driver Services (DDS) to reinstate your license.

In most circumstances you will pay a fee in court and a reinstatement fee at DDS.  If the court has issued a warrant for your arrest based on the FTA you are at risk of arrest until the warrant has been cleared by the Judge that issued the Warrant.
