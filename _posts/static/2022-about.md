Scott Kilts is a Washington-based artist, illustrator and designer who is passionate about UX. He loves to figure out how things work, how people work with things, and how to make things and people work better together.

A designer from birth, his early childhood was spent taping "inventions" together and cobbling costumes out of anything he could find. Progression was quickly made to writing instruments, crayons, sculpture and paint. Lucky enough to go to high school in an area with jewlery and pottery classes, he was also able to attend some basic art and design courses. 

The focus in university was purely technical, focused on Computer Science and Human Factors Psychology. That said, there was always an art project on the side. Grafitti markers turned to watercolors and black ink: the medium of choice. Easy to pack and travel, a constant distraction from homework and then office work.

While solving repetitive, simple, technical issues on wealthy people's fruit boxes he spent downtime, breaktime, and time on the clock with a pen on paper; sketching and drawing. Always working on something. 

Fascinated with letterforms he began studying calligraphy, came back to grafitti, left, and continues his passion as a student of typography. Half a decade and a few jobs later he has experience in branding, marketing, graphic design, signage, illustration, art direction and remains excited for new oportunities!
