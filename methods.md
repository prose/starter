## UCD

### UCD Principles

The ISO standard describes 6 key principles that will ensure a design is user centered:

1. The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
2. Users are involved throughout design and development.
3. The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
4. The process is iterative.
5. The design addresses the whole user experience.
6. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

## Lean 

### Lean Principles

* Start with best guess 
* Externalise & be explicit about assumptions
* Build to test
* Focus on learnings, not deliverables


### Process

#### Understand

* Immersion â€” When starting a new phase/product feature
	- To build tacit knowledge

* Define Assumptions
* Clarify Hypothesis
* Choose best method of Testing


#### Prototype & Build
* Build 'Minimum Testable Product'
	- Focus on testability, rather than complete product

##### Prototyping Tools

* [Pop](http://popapp.in) (iOS/Android)
* Keynote

**High Fidelity**
* Quartz Composer
* Frame.js
* XCode
* HTML/CSS

**General Tools**
