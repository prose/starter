# Rogo Design Principles

Rogo as a product will encompasses a complex set of features and will need to accommodate a variety of user needs — An ecosystem of applications as part of an integrated suite. This document aims to define some overarching principles that will shape a consistent user experience across applications. In addition to this, each product should in a similar manner set the principles relevant to the product scope and user needs.

## Overview

1. Start with User Needs
2. Understand Context
3. Make Assumptions Explicit & Test Early
4. Design with Data & Build upon Past Learnings
5. Be Consistent, not Uniform
6. Put the User in Control

### 1. Start with User Needs*

*Not Business needs or System needs. On the other hand, each user will have business/systems needs they need to support to perform their job, which should be made explicit as User Needs. 

The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real user needs.

As far as possible, we should make Rogo human centred. It should be a tool focused on supporting the company’s various users, from team to directors, rather than abstractly defined “business requirements”. If assumptions are made around requirements for the business, let us clarify user needs are behind such requirements and as far as possible translate such assumptions into tangible user needs.

### 2. Understand Context 

We’re not designing for a screen, we’re designing for people.

As far as possible, try to understand the context in which users work, not simply how interactions can be improved in the system. 

Example (To update: Inbox for timesheet)

### 3. Make Assumptions Explicit & Test Early

Rather than spending a lot of time doing user research on something that is ambiguous, make assumptions about what is our ‘best guess’ and test it as early as possible. 

Articulate the assumptions we make with the team, prototype to concretise ideas and test with actual users. It is better to make mistakes early, learn from our mistakes and redesign than to carefully design based on a long user research phase and presumably, still find mistakes. 

Example (Possibly user story 79…)

### 4. Design with Data & Build upon Past Learnings

We are not starting from scratch. Users are already using Rogo and have been for the past 8-9 years. This means we can learn from actual behaviour, past and present. 

We should make sure we continue this into the build and development process — prototyping and testing with real users. We should understand the desire paths of how we are designing with data and use them in our designs.

Example (To update: after iteration of Syntax in inbox)

### 5. Be Consistent, not Uniform

Wherever possible we should use the same language and the same design patterns — this helps people get familiar with Rogo as a whole. But, when this isn’t possible, we should make sure our underlying approach is consistent.

We should avoid making Rogo a patchwork of discrete tools. As far as possible, we should design for a consistent experience. 

Example


### 6. Put the user in control

We need to ensure that users feel in control acting on anything in the system. At present, some users are hesitant to make changes in the system, because they feel it may have some ripple effects.  

As far as possible, we should make it clear what will happen before users take action, and make the feedback from any user action apparent so that they gradually learn and feel confident with using the system.
